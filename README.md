## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist based in DC, currently working for USAC. I'm also a big sports fan.

This github profile is a storage locker for all the crazy ideas I have related to data science, most of which revolve around trying to explain ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ âš½ better.

I'm still learning how to use this platform better, so feel free to reach out with any inquiries or questions to [my gmail](mailto:matt.barger86@gmail.com).
